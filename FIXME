Things To Do
============

* PG gem fails to cast date fields as date. Nothing we can do about it.

* PG gem raises lots of "please cast this type explicitly" warnings for money,
  numeric types. There is no documentation for how to do this, and apparently
  no-one knows how /O\

* We probably want to raise a different error for underlying interface
  data-source problems than for user-caused problems like a missing ID
