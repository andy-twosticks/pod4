Things To Do
============

* PG gem fails to cast date fields as date. Nothing we can do about it.

* PG gem raises lots of "please cast this type explicitly" warnings for money,
  numeric types. There is no documentation for how to do this, and apparently
  no-one knows how /O\

* The routines that catch errors in the interfaces report themselves in the
  stack trace, which is unhelpful. Ideally they would take a context as a
  parameter which they could then pass to the raise statement.

* When you raise an alert it should at that point write the alert to the log,
  saving the user's program from having to do so.
