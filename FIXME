Things To Do
============

* PG gem fails to cast date fields as date. Nothing we can do about it.

* PG gem raises lots of "please cast this type explicitly" warnings for money,
  numeric types. There is no documentation for how to do this, and apparently
  no-one knows how /O\

* The routines that catch errors in the interfaces report themselves in the
  stack trace, which is unhelpful. Ideally they would take a context as a
  parameter which they could then pass to the raise statement.

### mappings ###

Model needs to specifically differentiate between:

    1. Mapping the interface to the model (`set` by default)
    2. Mapping the model to the interface (`to_ot` by default)
    3. Exporting data to the application (`to_ot`, all the time)
    4. Importing data from the application ('set' by default).

The current code works fine until you want to change the representation of a
column -- eg, a list on the DB to be shown as an array in the model.

Planned change:

* `to_ot` becomes specifically for exporting data from the application. Code as
  now.

* `set` becomes specifically for importing data from the application. Code as
  now.

* New method `map_to_model` is called to set the model attributes from the
  interface. The default code just calls `set`.

* New method 'map_to_interface` is called to translate model attributes into an
  OT for the interface. The default code just calls 'to_ot'.
